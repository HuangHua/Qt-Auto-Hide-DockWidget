# Qt Auto Hide DockWidget

A simple implementation of the Qt5 Auto Hide DockWidgets. Auto Hide docking widgets are similar to the pinnable windows in Visual Studio. QDockWidget can be unpinned to enter an auto-hide state. When in this state, tabs for each dockwidget appears on the outer edges of the mainwindow. To use the dockwidget again, click on the tab so that the dockwidget comes back into view.
